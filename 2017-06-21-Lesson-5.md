    <td>In today's lesson we did something a little different instead of doing codecademy. Instead, we talked about something different. We were asked at the beginning how do you make a cup of tea. We gave our answers to making a cup of tea but they were wrong as we werenâ€™t being precise enough. No one specified the amount of water you pour into the teapot or the amount you put in the kettle as if there is too little then it will burn out and too much will spill. This is related to coding because you have to give specific orders without one mistake that would ruin it all.
