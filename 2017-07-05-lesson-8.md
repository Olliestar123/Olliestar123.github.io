    <td>Today I made sure that I read through the descriptions and instructions precisely to make sure that I didn't make any stupid mistakes in my coding. This technique worked surprisingly well as beforehand I used to not read them properly and therefore make what would otherwise be obvious mistakes. I did have to ask the person next to me for help on a little bit of code. But I think that It was me being impatient as i have completed similar tasks before.</td>

    <td>Today nothing really limited my learning as I wasn't distracted and I tried to get on as quickly and as effectively as I could go. I think it was a very productive lesson. Also on my website I have changed the layout again I am trying to find the best contrasting colours</td>

    <td>Next time, hopefully I will be able to get past the 60% mark and have a good looking blog. I'm thinking about making it look quite dark and mysterious and have an intricate background.</td>
