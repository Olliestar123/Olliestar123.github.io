    <td>This lesson we developed on the code from last lesson. We started by adding code for each item of clothing e.g. H for hoodies. We were able to then create code -using VLOOKUP again- to mean that instead of writing in the whole word but to instead be able to write one or two letters that corresponded to the word to save time. We then added a drop down list so that you didn't even have to write anything in to avoid spelling mistakes! This quickens up the process even more and it is also very easy to do. We also added a column to work out the sales price using the cost to make it and the profit margin. We were then able to use VLOOKUP once again for the order form for the customer to see how much the product is. This lesson I have learnt a lot. I am able to use VLOOKUP without having help on remembering how to use it, I can now  make and use drop down boxes and use % to calculate sums like VAT and sales price.
