    <td>To kick off this new half term, we moved onto a new topic on spreadsheets - Cryptography. To start this subject we used a very basic code called the caesar cipher. This cypher uses a change of +3 on the alphabet eg. A turning to D. We then used code to create something that converted original text into encrypted text and back again (as seen below). This used VLOOKUP and I did it quite easily as it is just basic code.</td>
