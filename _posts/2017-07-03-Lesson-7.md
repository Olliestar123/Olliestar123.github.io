    <td>I worked well through the lesson this week but it wasn't the coding that was my main focus because my blog looks terrible -hopefully it doesnâ€™t anymore- and that is what I need to work on. Right now, my blog looks out of order and boring but I want people to be impressed when looking at it.</td>
