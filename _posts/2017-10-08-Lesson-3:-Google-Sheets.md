    <td>This lesson we were set a task to add costs of running or businesses and adding 3 more sheets. One called costs, losses and profits. I didn't know what I needed to put on losses and profits because they're probably for next lesson, so on costs I made a new table. I made it for per day so that I can then multiply it for weeks, months and years. The costs I thought were suitable for my hypothetical company were power, postage packaging, stationery, insurance and advertisement.</td>
