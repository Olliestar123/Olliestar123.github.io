    <td>Today we continued looking at cryptography. We started by remembering what we did last lesson which was on the Caesar cypher - a simple cypher created by Caesar to encode messages. Then we talked about how to use the left and right command to single out letter(s) in a cell. I didn't fully understand how to do this properly at first but after trial and error I figured out how to work it. Another code we used was len which calculates amount of digits in a cell. It's a very simple code but Iâ€™m sure it will come in helpful in the future.</td>
