  <tr>
    <td>Carrying on from last lesson, we added two new columns called "code" and another called “Cost Price.” We deleted the contents out of our sale price column and entered a new number into our cost price column. We then put a number into a different cell on the spreadsheet. This number is from 0%-100% and will be how much profit you want to make.Then enter this into each of your sale price cells. We then created a separate price using VLOOKUP and a code box on the order form where you can choose what you want to order.</td>
