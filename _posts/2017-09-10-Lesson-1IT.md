    <td>This was the first lesson of the academic year. We started -what will probably become a project- Google Sheets. I have no experience in sheets as I've never had lessons in it and don't use it because for now I have no reason to despite lessons. We learnt that Google Sheets is needed for any business to function as it deals with finances and shows what's needed. We have started to simulate basics of a business. I chose a clothing business. So far, we have made a table with a few commands. These commands multiply the amount of the item sold by the amount it costs to give a total. It was very basic and I'm sure that we will be venturing into more detail and complications further into the year.</td>
