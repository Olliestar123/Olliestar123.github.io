    <td>At the beginning of today's lesson, we were talking about the significance of spreadsheets out of school.

This shows how important it is for us to learn how to use spreadsheets.

Today's lesson we learned how to incorporate discount codes into our sheets. I had one for 10%, 20% and 50%. Once again, VLOOKUP allowed the order form to transfer the discount if a correct code is put in (as seen below).</td>
