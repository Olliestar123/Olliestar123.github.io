    <td>I didn't make as much progress this week. I think it was down to the fact that the work is getting harder and I'm setting my goals too high for a 1 hour lesson. The final reason is that I ended up using trial and improvement to complete the stages. This took quite a while compared to other methods. But it did work.</td>
